# WeatherStation

## Project Overview

Greetings from our weather station! A group of committed students worked together to create this project, which aims to create an inventive solution using cloud-deployed, resilient backend system, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and an easy-to-use frontend interface. 

## Project Components

### 1. IoT Device
Our project is built around our IoT device, which allows for real-world data collection and interaction. It is intended to gather temperature, humidity, wind speed, and light (whether sunny or cloudy) from a particular area or city. 

### 2. Backend with Cloud
Our project's backend system, which handles user interactions, processes data from IoT devices, and securely stores data on the cloud, is its brains. Some of our backend's salient features are:
- **Data Processing**: Efficient handling of incoming data streams from IoT devices.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- **Database Management**: Keeping and retrieving information from a dependable, scalable cloud database.
- **APIs**: Clearly defined APIs that help frontend and backend components communicate with one another.

### 3. Frontend
Users can interact with our system in a smooth and simple way thanks to the frontend interface. It provides features like these:
- **Real-time Updates**: Dynamic data visualization gleaned from IoT devices in real-time.
- **Configuration Settings**: Adjustable parameters to personalize the user interface.
- **Responsive Design**: Compatibility for a range of screens and devices.
